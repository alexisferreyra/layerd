Welcome to LayerD's wiki. Here you will start knowing everything you need about this project.

## What's LayerD? ##
LayerD is a technology that deals with some of the most serious problems in Software Engineering at present, such as portability, re-usage and the capacity to create abstractions as well as multiplatform software performance.
LayerD is made up of a framework of technologies that provide a means to construct efficient, reliable, secure multiplatform software with a huge economy of resources in its development. Such technology framework consists of the following;

<br>

The Meta-Languages and compilers are high level programming languages, focused on programmers, analysts and engineers productivity since they provide the most appropriate means for software development with a high abstraction level.<br>
<br>
ZOE language and its modular compiler are the LayerD technology machinery. ZOE Language is an intermediate technology-centered and ordinary language. In general, it is a high level object-oriented imperative language but it has some unique extension mechanisms beneficial to the highest level Meta-Languages.<br>
The LayerD Code Generators are software components that handle each implementation platform details and are a part of the last software production stage under LayerD paradigm.<br>
<br>
In despite of the fact that LayerD is a complete software development framework, it does not demand a great amount of time or effort in its learning because it is simply based on Object-Oriented technology which has been taken to its utmost expression in every software development level.<br>
