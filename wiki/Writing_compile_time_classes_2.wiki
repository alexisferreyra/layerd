#summary writing compile time classes
ere we'll show another example of Compile Time Classes (CTC). Particularly, a Logging Aspect through CTC.

== EXAMPLE #1: Implementing an Aspect ==

We want to implement an "aspect" that adds _Logging_ messages in the body functions. 
We are going to create a CTC that will add some lines of log to every body of every function of every class of a namespace. Then, the body of the functions after be processed by CTC will look like:
{{{
 Log.WriteLine("Entering function <functionName>");
 Log.WriteLine("- argument <var1> :" + <var1>);
 ....
 <function body>
 ...
 Log.WriteLine("Exiting function <functionName>");
}}}

 In this example we are going to see:

 * How to compile and test CTC with an ordinary class as example.
