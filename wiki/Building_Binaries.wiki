= Getting the binaries =

== Windows ==
Follow these steps:

 # Checkout the source code
 # Open the LayerD.sln solution file with Visual Studio 2010
 # Build the solution

You will find the binaries for Meta D++, Zoe Compiler and all supported code generators in the folder `trunk\layerdxplc_net\bin` in debug or release folder depending the configuration used to build.

== Linux ==

To build LayerD in Linux you will need to install Mono.
Current version is not fully tested under Linux but it should work with a bit of effort.

 # Compile metadppc parser using make (folder `trunk\layerddpp`)
 # Build Zoe compiler using mono build system

= LayerD CodeDOM Documentation =

CodeDOM documentation is an in-progress work. But it will be needed to write compile time classes that transform the AST or interact with Zoe Core.

To create the CodeDOM doc use doxygen

 # Move into the trunk folder
 # Call `doxygen` in the command line

The CodeDOM documentation will be accessible in `trunk\doc\html\index.html`
