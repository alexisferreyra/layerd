==What's LayerD?==
LayerD is a technology that deals with some of the most serious problems in Software Engineering at present, such as portability, re-usage and the capacity to create abstractions as well as multiplatform software performance.
LayerD is made up of a framework of technologies that provide a means to construct efficient, reliable, secure multiplatform software with a huge economy of resources in its development. Such technology framework consists of the following;

The Meta-Languages and compilers are high level programming languages, focused on programmers, analysts and engineers productivity since they provide the most appropriate means for software development with a high abstraction level.

ZOE language and its modular compiler are the LayerD technology machinery. ZOE Language is an intermediate technology-centered and ordinary language. In general, it is a high level object-oriented imperative language but it has some unique extension mechanisms beneficial to the highest level Meta-Languages.
The LayerD Code Generators are software components that handle each implementation platform details and are a part of the last software production stage under LayerD paradigm.

In despite of the fact that LayerD is a complete software development framework, it does not demand a great amount of time or effort in its learning because it is simply based on Object-Oriented technology which has been taken to its utmost expression in every software development level.

If you want to '''download''' the '''SDK''' please click [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/layerd here]. 

We are moving the project from `SourceForge` hosting to Google Code. Also, there is a lot of effort going on in a commercial project that use LayerD. Expect that work to be integrated in the open source some time in 2011.

If you want collaborate with LayerD join us in Google Code!
